Based on a project by [BatCake69](https://github.com/Batcake69)

The file names are based on the MD5 hash of the sexuality/gender identity name (so they can't be decrypted by your parents because what do they know about cryptography).

So far, flags have been made for:

- [Lesbian](https://flux3on.github.io/co/f83d1d6a12fda81723574437436b05e7.html)
- [Transgender](https://flux3on.github.io/co/2d632e7f0b20d419852012d299cb401b.html)
